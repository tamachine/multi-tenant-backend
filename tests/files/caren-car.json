For more space, we think this car is perfect for couples or groups of up to 4 max so you can store some luggage on the middle rear seat.<\/p>\n\n<p>Traveling with young children? The Yaris is compatible with front and rearward-facing child seats. Please note that it is not ISOFIX compatible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s more than meets the eye with this small but mighty car. With a USB &amp; AUX audio port, air conditioning, Bluetooth compatibility, and power steering - it has all the essential features you need in a budget small rental car.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Toyota Yaris is&nbsp;<u>not permitted to drive on F-Roads<\/u>. Please note that off-road driving is highly illegal in Iceland. It can result in legal prosecution and hefty fines.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re on the lookout for a spacious yet compact small car, the Yaris is an obvious choice. It&rsquo;s the perfect option for couples or small groups on the lookout for a budget rental car for urban exploration in Iceland.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Toyota Yaris is only available with an automatic transmission.<\/p>\n",
